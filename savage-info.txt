------------------------ About ----------------------

SAVAGE is a program that can reconstruct haplotypes from a set of reads in FASTQ format
using overlap graphs. SAVAGE supports de novo reconstruction; that is, without requiring
a reference sequence. The test script uses the de novo method. SAVAGE also supports the
reference-guided reconstruction common to most haplotyping software. This method runs
much faster than the de-novo method, but may lead to bias in the results, based on
the quality of the reference genome provided.


----------------------- Setup ------------------------

The SAVAGE testing script runs on SAVAGE. If you do not have SAVAGE installed,
install it by running the included script:

	bash install-savage.sh

This will create a conda environment named "savage" from which the software will be run
and create a directory called savage-tests from which the data will be tested.


Next, obtain the latest copy of veg-haplo-short.tar.gz or veg-haplo-complete-tar.gz,
and place it in this directory. Unzip it by entering:

	tar -xvzf veg-haplo-short.tar.gz or
	tar -xvzf veg-haplo-complete.tar.gz

depending on the file you are using. 

	NOTE: * veg-haplo-complete.tar.gz is a large file. It may take 10-20 minutes to unzip.
        * Due to the large file sizes, the unzip may result in the command prompt appearing
          to stall for a few minutes at the end of the unzip process.

This will place the following items in this directory:

	* a directory called "test-data", containing the data to run SAVAGE. Each dataset is numbered
		sequentially 1, 2, 3, etc. and is located in test-data/454/
	* an empty directory called "shorah-tests", which will not be used by this script.
	* env_C2V5.fas, the reference sequence for the test data in FASTA format. This an optional input
		for reference-based haplotype reconstruction, which will not be used in the current version
		of the SAVAGE test script.

--------------------- Usage -----------------------------

To run SAVAGE on a dataset, type

	bash test-savage.sh <number>

		for example:

	bash test-savage.sh 10

To run SAVAGE on a specific server, type:

	bash test-savage.sh -s <server> <number>

		for example, to run dataset 10 on server 5, run:

	bash test-savage.sh -s 5 10

<number> is the dataset number. As mentioned in the Setup, each data set is numbered sequentially
1, 2, 3, etc. As of writing, the latest version of veg-haplo-short.tar.gz contains 20 data sets,
and veg-haplo-complete.tar.gz contains about 160.

<server> is the node on the cluster that the process will run on. The program will run on one of the
CPUs on the specified node. If not specified, the process will run on the default node.

If you see the console message "patch 0 - De novo overlap computations - Running rust-overlaps",
then SAVAGE is running properly.

	NOTE: SAVAGE may take several hours or days to run, depending on the number of reads in the input files.
				After executing the script, SAVAGE will display the number of reads under the message "Input fastq stats".
 				Run time seems to be exponentially related to the number of reads. Datasets with a few thousand reads may
				take minutes to run, while datasets with over 20,000 reads will likely take a day or more to run.

The output will be placed in the folder "savage-tests" inside a directory corresponding to the dataset number entered.
The final haplotypes will be stored in the file contigs_stage_c.fasta, and a text file containing all the logs
printed to stdout by the program will be stored at output.txt.
