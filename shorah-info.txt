#     Installing and Testing ShoRAH     #

---------- Setup ----------

The ShoRAH testing script runs on ShoRAH. If you do not have ShoRAH, install it by entering:

	conda install -c bioconda -y shorah

Make sure that ShoRAH has been set up properly by typing this in the command line:

	shorah.py -h

A help message from ShoRAH should appear.


Next, obtain the latest copy of veg-haplo-short.tar.gz or veg-haplo-complete-tar.gz,
and place it in this directory. Unzip it by entering:

	tar -xvzf veg-haplo-short.tar.gz or
	tar -xvzf veg-haplo-complete.tar.gz

depending on the file you are using. 

	NOTE: * veg-haplo-complete.tar.gz is a large file. It may take 10-20 minutes to unzip.
        * Due to the large file sizes, the unzip may result in the command prompt appearing
          to stall for a few minutes at the end of the unzip process.

This will place the following items in this directory:

	* a directory called "test-data", containing the data to run ShoRAH. Each dataset is numbered
		sequentially 1, 2, 3, etc. and is located in test-data/454/
	* an empty directory called "shorah-tests", the output folder for the results of test-shorah.sh
	* env_C2V5.fas, the reference sequence for the test data in FASTA format.

---------- Usage -----------

To run ShoRAH on a dataset, type

	bash test-shorah.sh <number>

		for example:

	bash test-shorah.sh 10

<number> is the dataset number. As mentioned in the Setup, each data set is numbered sequentially
1, 2, 3, etc. As of writing, the latest version of veg-haplo-short.tar.gz contains 20 data sets,
and veg-haplo-complete.tar.gz contains about 160.

	NOTE: ShoRAH may take several minutes to run, depending on the number of reads in the input files.
				The sequence assembler will display "dispatched: " showing the number of reads. Run time seems
        to be exponentially related to the number of reads. Test runs with 15000+ reads may take 10+ minutes to run.

The results will be placed in the folder "shorah-tests" inside a directory corresponding to the dataset number entered.
